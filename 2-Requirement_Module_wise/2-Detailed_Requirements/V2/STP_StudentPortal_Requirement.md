# STP — Student Portal
## Module Requirement Document V2
**Version:** 2.0 | **Date:** 2026-03-26 | **Status:** Draft | **Mode:** FULL

---

> **CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE — RESIDUAL IDOR:** `proceedPayment()` still accepts `payable_id` from the client without validating it belongs to the authenticated student. `viewInvoice()` and `payDueAmount()` have been partially fixed with `where('student_id', ...)` scoping, but this is insufficient — `FeeInvoice` may not have a direct `student_id` column; the correct guard is via `feeStudentAssignment`. Zero `Gate::authorize()` or `$this->authorize()` calls exist anywhere in the module's 7 controllers. Role middleware (`role:Student|Parent`) is applied at the RouteServiceProvider level — this is the only RBAC boundary currently in place.

## 1. Executive Summary

The Student Portal (STP) module is the **student-facing self-service interface** of Prime-AI. It allows enrolled students (and optionally their parents/guardians) to access academic information, view timetables, track homework and assignments, view exam schedules and results, pay fee invoices online, monitor attendance, access library records, download progress cards, view transport allocations, and raise complaints — all through a dedicated portal separate from the administrative backend.

**Current Completion (as of 2026-03-26):** ~55%

Since V1 (gap analysis date: 2026-03-22), development has progressed substantially. The module now has **7 controllers** (up from 3), **55+ routes** covering 35+ distinct pages, and **57 Blade view files** (up from ~20). The dashboard is fully populated with real data: attendance stats, today's timetable, pending homework, upcoming exams, and fee summary are all live. Timetable, attendance, syllabus progress, LMS (homework/quiz/quest/exam), teachers directory, transport, library, progress card, recommendations, and fee summary screens are now built but carry varying degrees of business-logic completeness.

**Remaining critical gaps:**
- IDOR vulnerability in `proceedPayment()` — `payable_id` not validated server-side
- Zero `Gate::authorize()` or policy-based authorization in any controller
- No `FormRequest` classes (7 controllers use inline validation or none)
- No `Service` classes (business logic lives in controllers)
- No `EnsureTenantHasModule` middleware
- Scaffold stub methods (`index`, `create`, `store`, `show`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy`) still exist in `StudentPortalController`
- Leave application, school calendar, hostel, online exam, quiz/quest player screens are stubs (view-only, no data)
- Hard-coded dropdown ID `104` in `StudentPortalComplaintController`
- `test-notification` route must be removed (not yet confirmed removed)

**Risk Level:** HIGH (security) | **Estimated Remaining Effort:** ~15 person-days

## 2. Module Overview

### 2.1 Purpose

StudentPortal provides a **student-facing self-service interface** operating on the tenant's domain. It renders a dedicated UI experience with its own layout (`studentportal::components.layouts.master`) completely separate from the admin backend. Students authenticate via the same `sys_users` table but are restricted to portal routes via the `role:Student|Parent` Spatie middleware.

## 3. Stakeholders and Roles

| Actor              | Role Code | Access Level                                                                                |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Student            | Student   | Primary actor. Full access to own portal data; zero access to other students' data         |
| Parent / Guardian  | Parent    | Portal access when `can_access_parent_portal = 1` in guardian junction; reads child's data |
| School Admin       | Admin     | Manages student login credentials; grants/revokes portal access                            |

### 3.1 Authentication Model

- Student/Parent portal uses the same Laravel Auth (`sys_users` table) as admin users
- Student accounts: `user_type = 'STUDENT'`; parent accounts: `user_type = 'PARENT'` (or Spatie role `Student` / `Parent`)
- Portal route group has `role:Student|Parent` middleware applied at `RouteServiceProvider`
- After login, student lands on `student-portal/dashboard`
- Unauthenticated access to `student-portal/login` is public (no middleware)
- Standard Laravel password reset flow available

### 3.2 Proposed: Dedicated Student Auth Guard

📐 A dedicated `student` guard using `sys_users` with a scope filter (`user_type IN ('STUDENT','PARENT')`) is recommended to fully isolate portal session from admin sessions. Until then, Spatie `role:Student|Parent` is the only role gate.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### FR-STP-01: Student Login
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

- `ST.STP.4.1.1` — Student authenticates via email/username and password at `/student-portal/login`
- `ST.STP.4.1.2` — Login renders `studentportal::auth.login` view (separate from admin login)
- `ST.STP.4.1.3` — Failed login shows validation errors; successful login redirects to `student-portal.dashboard`
- `ST.STP.4.1.4` — "Forgot password" uses standard Laravel password reset
- `ST.STP.4.1.5` — 📐 Rate limiting (max 5 attempts / 2 min) to be applied via `throttle:5,2` middleware on login POST

### FR-STP-02: Student Dashboard
**Status:** ✅ Implemented (data fully populated since V1)

- `ST.STP.4.2.1` — After login, student lands on `/student-portal/dashboard`
- `ST.STP.4.2.2` — Dashboard displays attendance stats: total days, present count, attendance percentage (from `std_student_attendance`)
- `ST.STP.4.2.3` — Dashboard displays today's timetable cells from `tt_timetable_cells` filtered by student's class+section and current day-of-week
- `ST.STP.4.2.4` — Dashboard shows pending homework count (published homework not yet submitted by this student) — top 5 items shown
- `ST.STP.4.2.5` — Dashboard shows upcoming exam count and next 5 exams from `ExamAllocation` (CLASS + SECTION + STUDENT allocations)
- `ST.STP.4.2.6` — Dashboard shows fee summary: total fee, paid amount, outstanding balance, count of pending invoices
- `ST.STP.4.2.7` — Dashboard shows latest 10 notifications (paginated)
- `ST.STP.4.2.8` — Quick navigation tiles to major portal sections
- `ST.STP.4.2.9` — 📐 N+1 risk: `student->currentSession()` with multiple nested eager loads should be consolidated into one query chain with `with([...])`

### FR-STP-03: Academic Information
**Status:** 🟡 Partial (profile, guardian, health, fee loaded; attendance/exam partials exist as blade but data now available via dedicated routes)

- `ST.STP.4.3.1` — Full student profile: personal details, guardian info, addresses, academic session (class, section, roll number)
- `ST.STP.4.3.2` — Health profile summary: blood group, allergies, chronic conditions

**Status:** 🟡 Partial (IDOR partially fixed; residual gap in proceedPayment)

- `ST.STP.4.4.1` — Student views individual invoice at `/student-portal/view-invoice/{invoice}`
- `ST.STP.4.4.2` — `viewInvoice()` now scopes query with `->where('student_id', auth()->user()->student->id)` — partial IDOR fix
- `ST.STP.4.4.3` — Invoice detail shows: invoice number, date, due date, base amount, concession, fine, tax, total, paid amount, balance due, status
- `ST.STP.4.4.4` — 📐 **Recommended fix:** Use `FeeInvoice::whereHas('feeStudentAssignment', fn($q) => $q->where('student_id', $studentId))->findOrFail($id)` to guard against cases where `student_id` column may not exist directly on `fee_invoices`

### FR-STP-05: Fee Payment
**Status:** 🟡 Partial (IDOR remains in proceedPayment)

- `ST.STP.4.5.1` — Payment initiated at `/student-portal/pay-due-amount/pay-now/{invoice}`
- `ST.STP.4.5.2` — `payDueAmount()` scoped with `->where('student_id', ...)` — partial IDOR fix
- `ST.STP.4.5.3` — Payment gateway list: uses `PaymentGateway::all()` — should be `PaymentGateway::active()->get()`
- `ST.STP.4.5.4` — `proceedPayment()` POSTs to `/student-portal/pay-due-amount/proceed-payment`; validates `amount`, `payable_type`, `payable_id`, `gateway` inline — **`payable_id` has no ownership check — IDOR still present**
- `ST.STP.4.5.5` — Routes through `PaymentService::createPayment()` → Razorpay checkout

## 5. Data Model

### 5.1 STP-Owned Tables

**StudentPortal has zero owned database tables.** The module is a read-focused portal that reads exclusively from other modules' tables. No `stp_` prefix tables exist in `tenant_db_v2.sql`.

### 5.2 Tables Consumed (Read or Write via External Models)

| Table                              | Module        | Access Pattern                                         |

    └── student [std_students]
         ├── profile [std_student_profiles]
         ├── addresses [std_student_addresses]

         │    └── invoices [fee_invoices]
         └── healthProfile [std_health_profiles]
```

**Known typo:** The relationship on `Student` model is named `currentFeeAssignemnt` (missing letter) — referenced in 3 controller methods. Must be corrected to `currentFeeAssignment`.

## 8. Business Rules

### 8.1 Data Isolation (Critical — Security)

- `BR.STP.8.1.1` — A student may only view their own invoices, profile data, attendance, and fee information. Any cross-student access is a critical security violation (IDOR).
- `BR.STP.8.1.2` — Invoice ownership must be verified via the fee assignment chain: `FeeInvoice::whereHas('feeStudentAssignment', fn($q) => $q->where('student_id', $student->id))->findOrFail($id)` — direct `where('student_id', ...)` on `fee_invoices` may fail if `fee_invoices` does not have a direct `student_id` column.
- `BR.STP.8.1.3` — `proceedPayment()` must verify `payable_id` belongs to the authenticated student before creating a Razorpay order. Server-side only — never trust the client-submitted `payable_id`.
- `BR.STP.8.1.4` — A guardian with `can_access_parent_portal = 1` in `std_student_guardian_jnt` may view their linked child's data only; must not view unrelated students' data.
- `BR.STP.8.1.5` — Notification `mark-read` must verify the notification belongs to `auth()->user()` before updating.
- `BR.STP.8.1.6` — Complaint listing must always scope to `created_by = Auth::id()` (currently correct).

### 8.2 Fee Payment Rules

- `BR.STP.8.2.1` — Student can only pay invoices in "Published", "Partially Paid", or "Overdue" status; "Paid" and "Cancelled" invoices must render read-only
- `BR.STP.8.2.2` — Minimum payment = INR 1; maximum = remaining balance (`total_amount - paid_amount`)
- `BR.STP.8.2.3` — Gateway selection must use `PaymentGateway::active()->get()` — not `::all()`
- `BR.STP.8.2.4` — Failed/cancelled Razorpay payments must not update invoice status; only webhook callback triggers status change
- `BR.STP.8.2.5` — Rate limiting on payment initiation: max 3 attempts per 5 minutes per user

### 8.3 Timetable Rules

- `BR.STP.8.3.1` — Only timetables with status `ACTIVE`, `GENERATED`, or `PUBLISHED` are shown to students
- `BR.STP.8.3.2` — Timetable is read-only from the portal; no edit capability
- `BR.STP.8.3.3` — Break/non-teaching cells are filtered out (`filter(fn($c) => !$c->is_break)`)

### 8.4 Attendance Rules

- `BR.STP.8.4.1` — Attendance is read-only; student cannot self-mark attendance
- `BR.STP.8.4.2` — Attendance status values recognized: `Present/P/present`, `Absent/A/absent`, `Late/L/late`, `Leave/leave/On Leave` — inconsistent casing should be normalized at the `StudentAttendance` model level

### 8.5 Complaint Rules

- `BR.STP.8.5.1` — Student can create complaints and view own complaints; cannot edit or delete after submission
- `BR.STP.8.5.2` — `complainant_user_id` must be forced to `Auth::id()` — must not accept arbitrary user IDs from client
- `BR.STP.8.5.3` — Hard-coded dropdown ID `104` must be replaced with a queryable constant (e.g., `sys_dropdowns` where `key = 'COMPLAINANT_STUDENT'`)

### 8.6 LMS Access Rules

- `BR.STP.8.6.1` — Homework shown to student must be PUBLISHED and assigned to their class+section
- `BR.STP.8.6.2` — Quiz/quest allocations must respect `cut_off_date` — expired assignments must not appear
- `BR.STP.8.6.3` — Exam allocations shown must be PUBLISHED and match CLASS, SECTION, or STUDENT-level targeting

## 9. Workflows

### 9.1 Fee Payment Workflow

```
Student → /pay-due-amount/pay-now/{id}
  → [SERVER] FeeInvoice::where('student_id', student->id)->findOrFail($id)  ← verify ownership
  → Render payment-page with active gateways
  → Student selects gateway + amount
  → POST /pay-due-amount/proceed-payment
      → [SERVER] Validate: amount, payable_type, payable_id, gateway
      → [SERVER] *** VERIFY payable_id belongs to student *** ← MISSING
      → PaymentService::createPayment([...])
      → Return Razorpay checkout data
  → Redirect to payment::razorpay.process-payment
  → Razorpay JS handles card/UPI capture
  → Razorpay webhook → update invoice status → notify student
```

### 9.2 Complaint Submission Workflow

```
Student → /complaint/create
  → Load: target types, complainant types (sys_dropdowns)
  → Load: ComplaintCategories (active)
  → Student fills form; selects category → AJAX loads subcategories
  → POST /complaint
      → [SERVER] Inline $request->validate([...])
      → [SERVER] $request->merge() injects DB-resolved values ← anti-pattern
      → Complaint::create([...]) with created_by = Auth::id()
      → Redirect with success flash
```

### 9.3 Dashboard Data Aggregation Workflow

```
Student → /dashboard
  → Load auth()->user()->student
  → Load currentSession() with classSection
  → Parallel data loads:
      ├── Attendance: StudentAttendance count (total + present)
      ├── Timetable: TimetableCell for today's day_of_week
      ├── Homework: published, not submitted, due-date sorted (limit 5)
      ├── Exams: ExamAllocation PUBLISHED, future, sorted (limit 5 shown, total count)
      └── Fee: fee assignment invoices sum (total, paid, due, pending count)
  → Load notifications (paginate 10)
  → Render dashboard/index view
```

---

## 10. Non-Functional Requirements

### 10.1 Performance

- `NFR.STP.10.1.1` — Dashboard must load within 2 seconds; eager-load all relationships in one chain to prevent N+1
- `NFR.STP.10.1.2` — Dashboard currently executes multiple separate queries for timetable, homework, exams, fee — should be consolidated with `with([])` eager loading
- `NFR.STP.10.1.3` — Complaint index must paginate (currently `->get()` without limit)
- `NFR.STP.10.1.4` — Library catalog: paginated at 24 per page (implemented)
- `NFR.STP.10.1.5` — Notification list: paginated at 10 per page on dashboard, 20 on notice board (implemented)
- `NFR.STP.10.1.6` — Attendance view: large datasets should paginate or be limited to current academic session (already scoped to session)

### 10.2 Security

- `NFR.STP.10.2.1` — **P0: Fix `proceedPayment()` IDOR** — `payable_id` must be server-side verified
- `NFR.STP.10.2.2` — `EnsureTenantHasModule` middleware must be applied to the portal route group
- `NFR.STP.10.2.3` — CSRF protection applies to all POST routes via web middleware (currently correct)
- `NFR.STP.10.2.4` — File uploads in complaint must validate: `mimes:jpg,jpeg,png,pdf`, `max:5120` (5 MB)
- `NFR.STP.10.2.5` — Session timeout for student portal: 30 minutes recommended (vs admin: 60 minutes)
- `NFR.STP.10.2.6` — Rate limiting on payment initiation: `throttle:3,5` (3 per 5 minutes)
- `NFR.STP.10.2.7` — `notifications/{id}/mark-read` should be POST/PATCH to prevent pre-fetch attacks
- `NFR.STP.10.2.8` — Complaint `description` field should sanitize HTML (strip tags or use `htmlspecialchars`)
- `NFR.STP.10.2.9` — No stack traces visible to students; all exceptions must render student-friendly error pages
- `NFR.STP.10.2.10` — Fee pages must not store card details; Razorpay tokenization handles PCI compliance

### 10.3 Usability

- `NFR.STP.10.3.1` — Portal must be fully responsive (Bootstrap 5 / AdminLTE 4 base)
- `NFR.STP.10.3.2` — All error messages must be student-friendly
- `NFR.STP.10.3.3` — Payment status feedback must be immediate (webhook + callback)
- `NFR.STP.10.3.4` — Timetable grid should highlight the current day column
- `NFR.STP.10.3.5` — Dashboard attendance/fee summary cards must show clear visual indicators (color-coded badges)

### 10.4 Compliance

- `NFR.STP.10.4.1` — Fee payment pages must comply with Razorpay's PCI DSS requirements
- `NFR.STP.10.4.2` — Guardian portal access must respect `can_access_parent_portal` flag in `std_student_guardian_jnt`
- `NFR.STP.10.4.3` — Student data access must respect Indian DPDP Act 2023 requirements (data minimization, no unauthorized cross-student access)

## 14. Suggestions

### 14.1 P0 — Fix Immediately (Before Any Production Deployment)

**S-STP-01: Fix IDOR in `proceedPayment()`**
Add server-side ownership check before calling `PaymentService::createPayment()`:
```php
$invoice = FeeInvoice::whereHas('feeStudentAssignment',
    fn($q) => $q->where('student_id', auth()->user()->student->id)
)->findOrFail($request->payable_id);
abort_if($invoice->balance_amount <= 0, 422, 'Invoice already paid');
```

**S-STP-02: Verify `viewInvoice` / `payDueAmount` ownership guard is correct**
Current guard: `FeeInvoice::where('student_id', auth()->user()->student->id)->findOrFail($id)`. Confirm `fee_invoices` table has a direct `student_id` column. If not (i.e., ownership is via `fee_student_assignments`), switch to:
```php
FeeInvoice::whereHas('feeStudentAssignment',
    fn($q) => $q->where('student_id', auth()->user()->student->id)
)->findOrFail($id);
```

**S-STP-03: Add `EnsureTenantHasModule` middleware to portal route group**
In `RouteServiceProvider::mapWebRoutes()`, add `EnsureTenantHasModule:StudentPortal` to the middleware array.

**S-STP-04: Remove or gate the `test-notification` route**
Verify the `test-notification` route has been removed from `routes/tenant.php`. If it must remain, wrap in `App::environment('local')` check.

### 14.2 P1 — High Priority (Current Sprint)

**S-STP-05: Create `FormRequest` classes**
Minimum required:
- `StoreComplaintRequest` — rules for target_type_id, complainant_type_id, category_id, subcategory_id, description, attachment; `authorize()` returns `auth()->user()->hasRole('Student')`
- `ProcessPaymentRequest` — rules for amount (min:0.01), payable_type, payable_id (with custom ownership validation), gateway

**S-STP-06: Replace hard-coded dropdown ID `104` in `StudentPortalComplaintController`**
Lines 73 and 125 compare `$request->complainant_type_id` to integer `104`. Replace with:
```php
$studentType = \DB::table('sys_dropdowns')->where('key', 'COMPLAINANT_STUDENT')->value('id');
if ((int)$request->complainant_type_id === $studentType) { ... }
```
Or better: move the entire lookup into `StoreComplaintRequest`.

**S-STP-07: Fix `PaymentGateway::all()` → `PaymentGateway::active()->get()`**
In `payDueAmount()` method of `StudentPortalController`.

**S-STP-08: Fix typo `currentFeeAssignemnt` → `currentFeeAssignment`**
The relationship method on the `Student` model is misspelled. Three controller methods use it. Fix the relationship name and update all callers.

**S-STP-09: Paginate complaint index**
`Complaint::where('created_by', Auth::id())->get()` → add `->paginate(15)` and pass `->withQueryString()`.

**S-STP-10: Change `notifications/{id}/mark-read` from GET to POST/PATCH**
Prevents browser pre-fetchers (e.g., link scanners) from inadvertently marking notifications as read.

**S-STP-11: Remove scaffold stub methods from `StudentPortalController`**
Methods `index()`, `create()`, `store()`, `show()`, `edit()`, `update()`, `destroy()` at the bottom of the file are unused scaffold remnants. Remove them to reduce confusion and dead routes.

### 14.3 P2 — Medium Priority (Next Sprint)

**S-STP-12: Extract a `StudentPortalService` class**
Move dashboard aggregation logic (attendance stats, timetable, homework, exam, fee queries) into a dedicated `StudentPortalService`. The `dashboard()` method is currently 110+ lines.

**S-STP-13: Implement leave application workflow**
`/student-portal/apply-leave` currently returns a stub view. Implement:
- Leave application form (reason, start/end date, type, attachment)
- `StoreLeaveApplicationRequest`
- Store to an appropriate model (e.g., `std_leave_applications` — may require new table)
- Leave approval status display

**S-STP-14: Implement school calendar**
`/student-portal/school-calendar` currently returns a stub. Implement FullCalendar.js integration reading from school holiday/event tables.

**S-STP-15: Implement account settings backend**
Three tabs are view-only stubs:
- Password change: POST `/student-portal/account/password` → `Hash::check()` old + `Hash::make()` new
- Notification preferences: store channel toggles per user
- Privacy settings: store data visibility flags

**S-STP-16: Implement homework submission from portal**
Current `homework/index.blade.php` exists but there is no submission route. Add:
- `POST student-portal/homework/{homework}/submit` — `HomeworkSubmission::create([...])`
- File upload support
- Submission status display

**S-STP-17: Implement results with actual marks**
`/student-portal/results` shows concluded exam allocations but no marks. Integrate with `ExamResult` or equivalent model from LmsExam to display obtained marks, percentage, grade.

**S-STP-18: Wire quiz/quest player screens**
`quiz/index.blade.php` and `quest/index.blade.php` exist but have no routes. Add:
- `GET student-portal/quiz` → list assigned quizzes with status
- `GET student-portal/quest` → list assigned quests
- Link to quiz/quest player (may redirect to LmsQuiz/LmsQuests module URLs)

**S-STP-19: Fix notice board to use announcement model**
`/student-portal/notice-board` currently shows from `auth()->user()->notifications()`. Should display from a dedicated notice/announcement model (e.g., `sch_notices` or `sys_announcements`).

**S-STP-20: Add PDF download for progress card and ID card**
Progress card: link to HPC module's PDF generation route per report.
ID card: add a `/student-portal/student-id-card/download` route that generates a minimal PDF (via DomPDF).

### 14.4 P3 — Backlog

**S-STP-21: REST API for mobile/PWA**
Implement API endpoints (section 6.2) secured with `auth:sanctum`, returning JSON for mobile app or PWA integration.

**S-STP-22: Parent dashboard separation**
Currently Parent role users see the same dashboard as students. Build a separate parent view that:
- Lists linked children (from `std_student_guardian_jnt` where `can_access_parent_portal = 1`)
- Allows switching between children
- Shows aggregated data for selected child

**S-STP-23: Hostel integration**
Wire `/student-portal/hostel` when the Hostel module is complete. Show room number, block, floor, mess schedule, roommates.

**S-STP-24: Push notifications / FCM**
Add Firebase Cloud Messaging support for mobile push notifications alongside existing Laravel database notifications.

**S-STP-25: Add `Gate::authorize()` or `$this->authorize()` calls**
Even with Spatie middleware at the route group level, individual controller actions should use policy-based authorization for per-resource ownership checks. Create `StudentPortalPolicy` with methods:
- `viewInvoice(User $user, FeeInvoice $invoice)` — checks ownership
- `payInvoice(User $user, FeeInvoice $invoice)` — checks ownership + payable status
- `createComplaint(User $user)` — checks user is Student role
