Markdown (the .md format) is a lightweight markup language used to format text using plain-text syntax. It is widely used in documentation (like GitHub README.md files), technical writing, and communication tools.

Here are the most common codes and how they are used:

1. Headings (Structure)
    Headings are created using the hash # symbol. The number of hashes determines the level of the header.

    Code,Result,Use Case
        # Title,H1 (Largest),The main title of the document.
        ## Section,H2,Major section headings.
        ### Subsection,H3,Sub-topics under a major section.
        #### Topic,H4,Small sub-headers or labels.

2. Text Emphasis
    Use these to highlight specific words or phrases within your sentences.

    Bold: Wrap text in double asterisks: **Bold Text** → Bold Text

    Italic: Wrap text in single asterisks: *Italic Text* → Italic Text

    Strikethrough: Wrap text in double tildes: ~~Removed~~ → ~~Removed~~

    Bold & Italic: Use triple asterisks: ***Very Important*** → Very Important

3. Lists (Organizing Data)
    Markdown supports both ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

    Unordered List: Use *, -, or +.
    * Item 1
    * Item 2

    Ordered List: Use numbers followed by a period.
    1. First step
    2. Second step

    Task List: Use brackets to create checkboxes.
    - [x] Task Completed
    - [ ] Task Pending

4. Links and Images
    Links: [Text to Display](URL) — e.g., [Google](https://google.com)
    Images: ![Alt Text](ImageURL) — e.g., ![Logo](https://example.com/logo.png)

5. Blockquotes and Code
    These are essential for technical documentation.

    Blockquotes: Use the > symbol to highlight a note or a quote.

    > This is a note. → This is a note. 

    Inline Code: Use backticks (`) to highlight a variable or command.

    Example: Install the npm package.

    Code Blocks: Use triple backticks (```) to create a multi-line box for code or data.

6. Visual Separators & Tables
    Horizontal Rule: Use three dashes --- on a new line to create a visual divider.
    Tables: Use pipes | and dashes - to build a grid.
