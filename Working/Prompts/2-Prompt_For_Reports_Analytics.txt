Below is a production-grade, copy-paste ready MASTER PROMPT designed specifically for your School ERP Transport Module, keeping in mind that:

   - You are building a new-generation ERP from scratch
   - Transport has Standard + Advanced (Analytics & Prediction) layers
   - You will provide two SQL files:
     - tpt_transport_work.sql → Final Transport Module tables
     - tenant_db.sql → All other already-built ERP tables

You want: 

   - Exhaustive list of Reports
   - Advanced Analytics & Predictive Insights
   - Data feasibility check
   - New table recommendations (only if truly required)
Enterprise-level output suitable for FRD / Analytics Design Doc

This prompt is tuned for GPT-4.1 Mini / GPT-4o Mini and similar reasoning-capable models.

✅ MASTER PROMPT — Transport Reports & Advanced Analytics Designer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are a Senior Data Architect, Transport Operations Analyst, and AI Analytics Consultant
with 15+ years of experience in School ERP systems, Fleet Management, and Predictive Analytics.

I am building a next-generation AI-enabled School ERP from scratch.
I will provide you with TWO SQL files:

1) tpt_transport_work.sql
   → This contains the FINAL and COMPLETE database schema for the Transport Module
     (routes, stops, vehicles, drivers, attendants, student allocation, attendance,
      fuel, maintenance, GPS/logs if any, fees, trips, schedules, etc.)

2) tenant_db.sql
   → This contains all OTHER ERP tables already developed or under development
     (students, parents, staff, sessions, classes, sections, finance, attendance,
      HR, geography, holidays, calendar, permissions, etc.)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
YOUR OBJECTIVE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Analyze BOTH SQL files deeply and design an ENTERPRISE-GRADE "Transport Reports & Advanced Analytics Framework".

You must base everything STRICTLY on:
✔ data that already exists
✔ relationships across transport + other ERP modules
✔ real operational use-cases of school transport departments

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DELIVERABLES (MANDATORY)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

------------------------------------
SECTION 1 — DATA UNDERSTANDING
------------------------------------
1. Identify all major Transport data domains:
   - Fleet & Vehicles
   - Routes & Stops
   - Students & Staff allocation
   - Driver / Attendant operations
   - Attendance (student & staff)
   - Trips, schedules, shifts
   - Fuel, maintenance, breakdowns
   - Transport fees & billing linkage
   - GPS / distance / time logs (if present)

2. Identify cross-module data dependencies from tenant_db.sql
   (students, staff, sessions, calendar, finance, geography, etc.)

------------------------------------
SECTION 2 — STANDARD OPERATIONAL REPORTS
------------------------------------
Create a COMPLETE list of **Standard Transport Reports**.

For EACH report provide:
- Report Name
- Report Category
- Primary Tables Used
- Key Filters (date, route, vehicle, session, class, stop, etc.)
- Output Columns
- Frequency (Daily / Monthly / On-Demand)
- Intended User Role (Transport Head, Driver, Helper, Admin, Accountant, Principal, Teacher, Student, Parents)
- What all permissions those roles have from list of permissions (View, Add, Edit, Delete, Print, Export, Import)


Examples (but do NOT limit yourself to these):
- Route-wise Student Allocation
- Vehicle Occupancy Report
- Driver Attendance Report
- Stop-wise Pickup List
- Transport Fee Collection vs Allocation
- Vehicle Utilization Summary
- Maintenance Due Report

------------------------------------
SECTION 3 — ADVANCED ANALYTICS & KPI DASHBOARDS
------------------------------------
Design **Advanced Analytics & KPI Metrics**.

For EACH metric or dashboard:
- Metric / Insight Name
- Business Question it Answers
- Calculation Logic (conceptual)
- Tables & Fields Used
- Visualization Type (chart, heatmap, trend, KPI tile)
- Decision Enabled

Cover areas like:
- Route efficiency
- Vehicle under-utilization
- Driver performance & reliability
- Attendance irregularities
- Cost per student / per route
- Fuel efficiency (if data exists)
- Maintenance cost trends
- Posibility of Leakage in the system

------------------------------------
SECTION 4 — PREDICTIVE & AI-DRIVEN ANALYTICS
------------------------------------
Design **Predictive / AI-ready analytics**, such as:
- Route demand forecasting
- Route Suggestion to make any Route more Efficient / Profitable
- Vehicle capacity forecasting
- Driver absenteeism risk
- Breakdown probability
- Transport cost prediction per session
- Student transport churn (opt-in / opt-out risk)

For EACH prediction:
- Prediction Objective
- Required Historical Data
- Features involved
- ML readiness level (Low / Medium / High)
- Whether current schema is sufficient (Yes/No)

------------------------------------
SECTION 5 — GAP ANALYSIS & NEW TABLE SUGGESTIONS
------------------------------------
ONLY if required, suggest **new tables or fields**.

For each suggestion:
- Why existing data is insufficient
- New Table Name
- Columns with data types
- FK relationships
- Whether it is:
  - Mandatory
  - Optional (Advanced Analytics only)
  - Phase-2 enhancement

DO NOT suggest tables unless there is a strong analytical justification.

------------------------------------
SECTION 6 — REPORT ↔ ROLE MAPPING
------------------------------------
Map each Report / Dashboard to:
- Transport Head
- School Admin
- Principal
- Accountant
- Management

------------------------------------
SECTION 7 — FUTURE-READY ANALYTICS ARCHITECTURE
------------------------------------
Propose:
- Star-schema or reporting views (if needed)
- Pre-aggregated summary tables (if helpful)
- Real-time vs batch analytics split
- AI/ML data pipeline readiness

------------------------------------
SECTION 8 — FINAL SUMMARY
------------------------------------
Provide:
- Total number of Standard Reports
- Total number of Advanced Analytics
- Total number of Predictive Insights
- Whether current schema is:
  - Fully sufficient
  - Sufficient with minor additions
  - Needs structural enhancement

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✔ Do NOT assume imaginary columns
✔ Do NOT redesign existing tables
✔ Base everything on actual schema
✔ Be explicit, structured, and enterprise-ready
✔ Use professional ERP terminology
✔ Output should be suitable for:
  - FRD
  - Analytics Design Document
  - BI Dashboard Planning

When ready, wait for me to upload:
1) tpt_transport_work.sql
2) tenant_db.sql


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🎯 Why this prompt will work extremely well for you
  - Matches your ERP-architect mindset
  - Forces schema-driven analytics (no hallucination)
  - Produces actionable reports + AI roadmap
  - Separates Standard vs Advanced vs Predictive
  - Identifies only necessary DB changes
  - Output can be directly used in:
    - FRD
    - SRS
    - BI dashboard planning
    - Client demos

If you want, next I can:
  - Create separate prompts for:
    - Only Predictive Analytics
    - Only Management Dashboards
    - Only SQL View / Materialized View generation
  - Convert output into Excel / PPT / FRD template
  - Align analytics with NEP-2020 & CBSE compliance

Just tell me 👍

Promt for Antigrevity Chat Agent
--------------------------------


I am developing the Transport Module for a School ERP using PHP 8.x + Laravel 11 and MySQL.

Context Files Provided:
  - @tpt_transport_v1.8.sql: Contains schema for vehicles, routes, drivers, and fuel.
  - @tenant_db.sql: Contains core school data (students, classes, guardians, and multi-tenant IDs).
  - @Report_from_AI.txt: The detailed logic for each required report.

Task: Act as a Principal Laravel Architect. Analyze the provided DDLs and the requirements document to generate a complete reporting system. For each report, follow these implementation steps:





Thinking Step: > - Examine the MySQL DDLs. If there are missing indexes required for high-performance reporting (e.g., on date columns or vehicle_id), suggest a Laravel Migration to add them.

Output Structure:

DELIVERABLE — Report Design Document (sections per report)
  1. Overview — scope, responsibilities, owners, cross-module interactions.
  2. Screen Layouts — list of screens with Report Filters, and with purpose (Report, Print, PDF).
  3. Data Models — ER diagram in ASCII + table-to-field mapping and rationales.
  4. User Workflows — step-by-step happy path + alternatives + error handling for each key workflow.
  5. Visual Design — component list (header, table, forms, filters) and spacing/layout guidelines; include accessibility notes.
  6. Accessibility — WCAG AA checklist items for each screen; keyboard flows and ARIA roles.
  7. Testing — unit, integration, E2E, contract tests, security tests; provide sample test-cases and test-data.
  8. Deployment/Runbook — configuration, environment variables, startup sequence, backup and restore steps.
 10. Future Enhancements — 6 short actionable ideas, with complexity tags (low/med/high).
 11. Include Button in Visual Design to generate PDF and Print.

Apart from all above including other details, which you find usefull to provide to developer to develop the reports.

Save All output in resources/views/reports/transport



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Save all Backend logic in app/Services/Transport and app/Http/Controllers/Api.

Save views in resources/views/reports/transport.

Create a routes/api.php or web.php snippet for these new endpoints.

Start by outlining the schema relationships you see between the Transport DDL and the Tenant DDL to confirm your understanding."



Eloquent & Logic: > 
  - Write a dedicated Service Class (App\Services\Transport\ReportService) to handle the business logic.
  - Use Laravel Query Builder or Eloquent (with eager loading) for data retrieval.
  - Ensure every query is scoped by tenant_id to maintain multi-tenancy security.

API/Controller: > 
  - Create a TransportReportController with methods for each report.
  - Use API Resources to format the JSON output for the frontend.

Frontend (Blade/Livewire/Vue): > 
  - Provide a Laravel Blade view using Tailwind CSS.

  Implement a 'Print/PDF' layout using a library like barryvdh/laravel-dompdf logic.
