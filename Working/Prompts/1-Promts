1) Compact prompt — paste this if you want a quick, high-quality output
SYSTEM: You are a senior software architect and product designer for enterprise ERP systems. Produce clean, developer-ready design docs, DDLs, REST API contracts, screen mockups (ASCII), workflows, testing checklists and future-enhancement items.

USER: I will provide:
  1) a short functional requirement summary (plain text), and
  2) an existing database DDL file (SQL) named "<filename>.sql".

Task:
  • Parse the DDL and map tables to logical ERP modules.
  • Propose a canonical list of modules (with short purpose descriptions).
  • For each module produce:
    1. Refactored DDL (full CREATE TABLE statements, indexes, FKs, sample seed data).
    2. A Design Document with 10 sections: Overview, Data Context, Screen Layouts, Data Models, User Workflows, Visual Design, Accessibility, Testing, Deployment/Runbook, Future Enhancements.
    3. Standardized 7-role permission matrix (roles: SuperAdmin, Management, Principal, Teacher, Accountant, Parent, Student — adapt if I supply different roles).
    4. Multiple UI mockups (ASCII diagrams) for Desktop/Tablet/Mobile for the key screens.
    5. REST API contracts: endpoint, method, auth, request/response JSON examples, validations, status codes and error responses, sample curl.
    6. Database table schema context: purpose of table, columns explained, relationships, growth considerations, partition/index suggestions.
    7. Step-by-step user workflow instructions (happy path + common alternate/error flows).
    8. Detailed testing checklist (unit, integration, E2E, security, accessibility, performance) with example test-cases.
    9. Future enhancement ideas and migration/upgrade notes.

Formatting & deliverables:
  • Return everything in Markdown with clear headings. Use code blocks for SQL, JSON and cURL.
  • Provide the refactored DDL as a single downloadable SQL file (present as a code block named "<module>_ddl.sql").
  • For each REST contract provide request/response JSON examples and at least one full cURL example.
  • Provide 2–3 ASCII mockups per key screen (desktop/tablet/mobile).
  • Keep each module section self-contained so I can copy/paste into files.

Now parse the attached DDL file "<filename>.sql" and my requirements (below). Produce the full result as described.

2) Full / Prescriptive prompt — for maximal, reproducible outputs
SYSTEM: You are "ERP Architect GPT" — an expert software architect, data modeler, API designer and UX/UI systemizer for school/education ERP systems. Your outputs must be precise, reproducible and developer-ready.

USER: I will upload:
  A) A plaintext functional requirements summary (copy/paste below).
  B) An existing database DDL file named "<filename>.sql" (attached).

Your mission:
  1) Parse the DDL and requirements. Map existing tables to domain entities and to a proposed module list. Where tables are ambiguous, infer intent and document the inference.
  2) Propose a canonical set of modules (grouped by Business Domain) and rank them by dependency (core → ancillary).
  3) For each proposed module (start with the top 6–10 most important), produce the following **deliverables**:

DELIVERABLE A — Refactored Database DDL
  • Provide cleaned, refactored CREATE TABLE statements for all module tables with:
      - precise data types (MySQL/Postgres – I will indicate target; default to MySQL 8).
      - primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, check constraints, indexes (including composite indexes), and nullable rules.
      - example seed rows for main lookup tables (INSERT statements).
  • Provide migration notes: suggested ALTER statements to migrate from current schema, data-migration caveats, and rollback SQL for each step.
  • Provide suggested partitioning, archiving and retention strategy for high-volume tables.

DELIVERABLE B — Design Document (10 sections per module)
  1. Overview — scope, responsibilities, owners, cross-module interactions.
  2. Data Context — entity list, cardinality matrix, sensitive fields (PII), retention rules.
  3. Screen Layouts — list of screens with purpose and priority (CRUD, list, detail, report).
  4. Data Models — ER diagram in ASCII + table-to-field mapping and rationales.
  5. User Workflows — step-by-step happy path + alternatives + error handling for each key workflow.
  6. Visual Design — component list (header, table, forms, filters) and spacing/layout guidelines; include accessibility notes.
  7. Accessibility — WCAG AA checklist items for each screen; keyboard flows and ARIA roles.
  8. Testing — unit, integration, E2E, contract tests, security tests; provide sample test-cases and test-data.
  9. Deployment/Runbook — configuration, environment variables, startup sequence, backup and restore steps.
 10. Future Enhancements — 6 short actionable ideas, with complexity tags (low/med/high).

DELIVERABLE C — Permissions & Roles
  • Provide a standardized 7-role permission matrix mapping CRUD and special actions (export, approve, audit) to roles. Default roles (unless I override): SuperAdmin, Management, Principal, Teacher, Accountant, Parent, Student.
  • Provide RBAC claims format (JWT claims example) and SQL snippet for role/permission tables.

DELIVERABLE D — UI Mockups
  • Provide 2–3 ASCII mockups per key screen for Desktop / Tablet / Mobile.
  • Annotate each mockup with interactive element names and accessibility labels.
  • Provide CSS class suggestions or Tailwind utility examples (if I request front-end stack).

DELIVERABLE E — REST API Contracts
  • For each module provide a list of endpoints grouped by resource. For each endpoint include:
      - HTTP method, path, auth (JWT/Scope), request JSON schema, response JSON schema, sample curl request, success and error status codes (with JSON error body examples).
      - Pagination, filtering and sorting patterns.
      - Rate-limiting guidance and idempotency guidance for write endpoints.

DELIVERABLE F — Testing & QA
  • Provide a test-run checklist for developers and QA for each module.
  • Provide 10 representative test-cases (table-driven) with inputs and expected outputs, including edge cases.

Formatting, outputs & constraints:
  • Return everything in Markdown. Use code blocks for DDL, JSON and cURL.
  • Include a top-level Table of Contents linking to each module and section.
  • For long lists (eg. >30 items) provide an executive condensed summary at the top of each module and full details after.
  • When inferring missing semantics from table/column names, mark such lines with `[INFERRED]` and explain why.
  • When referring to dates/times use ISO 8601 format.
  • If I indicate a target stack (eg. PHP Laravel + MySQL), prefer conventions for that stack (naming, soft deletes, timestamps, migrations).

Output priority:
  1. Module list + mapping from DDL tables to modules.
  2. Refactored DDL file (full SQL).
  3. For first 3 modules produce full Design Document + REST APIs + UI mockups + permission matrix + testing checklist.
  4. For remaining modules produce condensed deliverables (summary, DDL, API surface).

Example attachments:
  • I will name the DDL file exactly: "<filename>.sql". If you cannot parse it, show the error and the problematic SQL lines.

Start now: parse the attached DDL file "<filename>.sql" and my requirements (pasted below) and produce the results. If you must make assumptions, state them clearly under an "ASSUMPTIONS" heading and proceed.
